These files are unused backups or duplicates and should be deleted to avoid confusion:
- src/pages/Post.jsx.new
- src/components/post-form/PostForm.jsx.bak
- src/components/post-form/PostForm.jsx.new
- temp-postform.jsx

I recommend deleting them. If you want to keep a backup, move them outside the src/ directory or into a dedicated backup folder not included in your build process.
